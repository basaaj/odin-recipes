        <h3 class="recipe-headings">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk soy sauce, sesame oil, brown sugar, rice vinegar, chili garlic sauce, and ginger together in a small bowl. Add peanut butter, whisking until well combined, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a pot. Discard the flavor packet and add ramen noodles to the boiling water. Cook until noodles are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain noodles, reserving some of the noodle water in case you need to thin out the sauce later.</li>
            <li>Pour sauce over ramen noodles, tossing until well coated. If sauce is too thick, thin out with a small amount of the reserved noodle water until you reach your desired consistency. Your hot noodles will soak up the sauce. Garnish with peanuts and green onion, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
